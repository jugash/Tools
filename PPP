# Observability Platform C4 Documentation

## Overview

This comprehensive document details the architecture of the enterprise observability platform leveraging Grafana, Loki, Mimir, and Alloy. Structured according to the C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code), it provides layered insights into the system's design, from high-level ecosystem interactions down to implementation specifics.

### Platform Scope and Objectives

- **Monitoring Coverage**: Tracks metrics, logs, and traces across diverse environments including production (PROD), enterprise production (ENT), enterprise non-production (ENT-NP), non-production (NP with sub-environments NP1/NP2 in DC1), engineering (ENG in DC2), pre-production (PP in both DCs), and member test (MT in both DCs).
- **Data Collection**: Alloy agents deployed as Kubernetes DaemonSets on clusters and via Ansible on VMs, ensuring comprehensive telemetry gathering.
- **Data Publishing**: Dual-write mechanism to both DC1 and DC2 for redundancy, secured via mutual TLS (mTLS).
- **Visualization and Storage**: Grafana for dashboards, Mimir for metrics, Loki for logs, all operating in active/active mode across data centers.
- **Load Balancing**: F5 appliances manage traffic distribution and failover.
- **Alerting and Notification**: Primary alerting via Mimir datasource rules, with secondary Grafana alerts; notifications routed through PagerDuty for incident management.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **High Availability**: Active/active deployment across two geographically distributed data centers (DC1 and DC2).
- **Security**: mTLS for all data transmissions; role-based access controls in Grafana.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of Mimir/Loki components; auto-scaling Alloy agents based on cluster size.
- **Resilience**: Dual publishing ensures data persistence even if one DC fails; F5 health checks enable automatic failover.
- **Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security and audit logging for regulated environments.

## Resilience and Risk Analysis

### Resilience Mechanisms

The platform is designed with multiple layers of resilience to ensure continuous operation and data integrity:

#### Data Redundancy and Durability

- **Dual Publishing**: Alloy agents send telemetry to both DCs simultaneously, ensuring no data loss if one DC becomes unavailable. This creates two independent data streams that can be reconciled during recovery.
- **Replication**: Mimir and Loki replicate data across DCs using synchronous writes for critical metrics/logs and asynchronous for bulk data. Retention policies ensure historical data is preserved in object storage (e.g., S3-compatible) with geo-redundancy.
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups of configurations and metadata; point-in-time recovery capabilities for up to 30 days.

#### High Availability and Failover

- **Active/Active DCs**: Both DCs serve traffic simultaneously; F5 load balancers distribute requests and perform health checks every 30 seconds. If a DC fails, traffic is automatically rerouted within 60 seconds.
- **Component Redundancy**: Multiple replicas of Mimir ingesters, queriers, and Loki distributors prevent single-point failures. Kubernetes ensures pod restarts and rescheduling.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Alloy agents implement exponential backoff and circuit breakers to handle downstream outages without cascading failures.

#### Scalability and Load Handling

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling groups for Alloy on VMs; HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) for K8s deployments based on CPU/memory metrics.
- **Rate Limiting**: F5 enforces request limits to prevent overload; Mimir distributors queue excess requests.
- **Caching**: Grafana caches query results; Mimir uses in-memory caches for hot data.

#### Disaster Recovery

- **RTO/RPO**: Recovery Time Objective of 4 hours; Recovery Point Objective of 15 minutes for critical data.
- **DR Drills**: Quarterly failover tests simulate DC outages.
- **Multi-Region**: DCs are in different geographic regions to mitigate regional disasters.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### Identified Risks

- **Network Partitioning**: If inter-DC links fail, data could be written to only one DC, leading to inconsistency.

  - **Mitigation**: Asynchronous replication with conflict resolution; monitoring for replication lag; manual intervention scripts.

- **Certificate Expiry**: mTLS certificates expiring could halt data ingestion.

  - **Mitigation**: Automated renewal via cert-manager; alerts 30 days before expiry; fallback to insecure mode with logging.

- **Storage Outages**: Object storage failures could make historical data inaccessible.

  - **Mitigation**: Multi-zone storage; read replicas; caching of recent data in local storage.

- **Alert Fatigue**: Over-alerting from Mimir could overwhelm PagerDuty.

  - **Mitigation**: Alert grouping and deduplication; severity-based routing; on-call rotation optimization.

- **Configuration Drift**: Manual changes to Alloy configs could cause inconsistencies.

  - **Mitigation**: GitOps for all configurations; automated validation; canary deployments.

- **Resource Exhaustion**: Sudden traffic spikes could overwhelm components.

  - **Mitigation**: Autoscaling; queueing; rate limiting; capacity planning based on growth forecasts.

- **Security Breaches**: Compromised certificates or misconfigurations could expose data.

  - **Mitigation**: Regular security audits; least-privilege access; encrypted at rest/transit; intrusion detection.

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependency on Grafana stack could complicate migrations.
  - **Mitigation**: Open standards (Prometheus, Loki formats); evaluation of alternatives; modular architecture.

#### Risk Monitoring and Response

- **Observability of Observability**: Meta-monitoring dashboards track platform health; alerts for platform issues.
- **Incident Response**: Runbooks for common failures; escalation paths to on-call teams.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Post-incident reviews; quarterly risk assessments.

## C1: Container Diagram

### Description

At the C1 level, we zoom into the software systems (containers) that make up the platform. Each container is a separately deployable and runnable unit, often corresponding to a process or group of processes. This view abstracts away code and focuses on runtime relationships and deployment boundaries.

#### Container Inventory and Responsibilities

- **Data Centers (DC1, DC2)**:

  - Physical or virtualized infrastructure locations.
  - Responsibilities: Host all platform components; provide network isolation and redundancy.
  - Technologies: On-premises hardware or cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure).
  - Scaling: Fixed locations, but components within can scale.

- **Kubernetes Clusters**:

  - Environments: PROD (production), ENT (enterprise prod), ENT-NP (enterprise non-prod), NP1/NP2 (non-prod in DC1), ENG (engineering in DC2), PP (pre-prod in both), MT (member test in both).
  - Responsibilities: Run application workloads; host Alloy agents for telemetry collection.
  - Technologies: Kubernetes with managed services (e.g., EKS, AKS) or self-hosted.

## C3: Code Level

### Description

C3 provides the most detailed view, showing actual code, configurations, and implementation specifics. This includes configuration files, deployment manifests, scripts, and code snippets that developers and operators interact with directly. Examples are provided for key components, with explanations of their purpose and customization options.

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR-001: Multi-Data Center Active/Active Deployment

**Context**: Need for high availability and disaster recovery across geographically distributed data centers.

**Decision**: Implement active/active deployment with dual-write data ingestion and synchronous replication for critical data.

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Zero RTO for most failure scenarios, improved resilience
- **Negative**: Increased complexity in data consistency management
- **Mitigation**: Implement conflict resolution strategies and monitoring

#### ADR-002: mTLS for All Data Transport

**Context**: Security requirements mandate encryption and mutual authentication for all telemetry data.

**Decision**: Use mTLS with automated certificate management for all inter-component communication.

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: End-to-end security, compliance with enterprise standards
- **Negative**: Certificate management overhead, potential connectivity issues
- **Mitigation**: Automated renewal, comprehensive monitoring, fallback mechanisms

#### ADR-003: Grafana Stack Selection

**Context**: Need for unified observability with metrics, logs, and visualization.

**Decision**: Adopt Grafana ecosystem (Grafana, Mimir, Loki, Alloy) for comprehensive observability.

**Consequences**:

- **Positive**: Integrated tooling, active community, vendor support
- **Negative**: Vendor lock-in potential
- **Mitigation**: Use open standards, evaluate alternatives periodically
